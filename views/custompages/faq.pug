					p
						| It makes us unique, provides people a space who want a SFW only site,
						| and keeps the site healthy. We are the only, as far as I'm aware,
						| open for all SFW site and there is a demand for a SFW imageboard.
						| It also makes it easier to moderate the site and avoids the blurry line
						| of what is and isn't allowed. Remember that unlike 4chan, the staff here are
						| all volunteers who also want to enjoy the site. Looking at porn all day,
						| is not what any of us want to do.

				th: a(href='#name-formatting') Name formatting
			tr
				td.post-message
					p When posting, you can format the name field to include a name, tripcode , capcode, any combination of the three including leaving the field completely blank.
					b Format
					p 
						| Names should be input like: 
						input(disabled='true' spellcheck='false' type='text' value='Name##Tripcode## Capcode')
						| . Tripcode and capcode are optional components. Please note the whitespace before capcodes is significant. 
					p Valid examples: 
					ol.mv-0
						li name
						li #tripcode
						li ##tripcode
						li ## capcode
						li name#tripcode
						li name##tripcode
						li name## capcode
						li name#tripcode## capcode
						li name##tripcode## capcode
						li #tripcode## capcode
						li ##tripcode## capcode
						li ##
					p The last example is considered a blank capcode and can be used as a shortcut to display your role. Additionally, if a user has multiple aplicable roles (e.g. a board owner, but the user is also global staff) capcodes will default to their lowest role. To show the higher role, you must be explicit and precede any capcode with the role name e.g. ## Global Staff or ## Global Staff capcode
					p Each component can be used in combination or independently. In a post number 9 would look like:
						-
							const examplePost = {
								"date" : new Date("2019-08-02T09:48:44.180Z"),
								"name" : "name",
								"board" : "example",
								"tripcode" : "!!X8NXmAS44=",
								"capcode" : "##Board Owner capcode",
								"message" : "Hello, world!",
								"nomarkup" : "Hello, world!",
								"thread" : 1,
								"password" : null,
								"email" : "",
								"spoiler" : false,
								"banmessage" : null,
								"files" : [ ],
								"reports" : [ ],
								"globalreports" : [ ],
								"quotes" : [ ],
								"backlinks" : [ ],
								"postId" : 123
							}	
						+post(examplePost)
					p The name appears bold in the top left, followed by the tripcode in regular weight with a !! prefix, then the capcode in a different color, bold and with a ## prefix. The colours may vary between themes but are generally distinct from each other

					b Name
					p The name is simply what name you want to be shown alongside your post. Other users can post with the same name so there is nothing preventing impersonation. This is not related to your username (for registered users).

					b Tripcode
					p A tripcode is a password of sorts, which users can provide in the tripcode component of their name. This tripcode is used in conjunction with a server-known secret to generate a unique* tripcode portion of the name. Long, unique tripcodes can be used as a form of identity. It is important that you keep tripcodes secret if you use them for some form of identity. A compromised tripcode can be used for impersonation and cannot be revoked in any way. Single # before tripcodes will use the traditional (what is now sometimes known as "insecure") tripcode algorithm shared by many imageboard softwares and websites. Double # before tripcodes will use a sha256 hash with server-side secret for a more secure, non-portable tripcode.

					b Capcode
					p A capcode is a component of the name field only available to authenticated users. This includes admins, global staff, board owners and board staff. If there is no text after the ##, the role will be displayed alone. Leaving a space and putting custom text will be prefixed by the role name. This way, the role is always shown to prevent role impersonation.

					b File approval
					p 
						| To protect users and honor the SFW only nature of this site. I implemented file approval.
						| New users will have their files pending approval, and need a moderator to verify that 
						| rules are not broken. Before a file is approved a 'File Pending Approval' replacement is 
						| shown, but after approval users will see the original file.
					b Trust system 
					p
						| Users may wish to create an account and become 'Trusted' to bypass file approval. 
						| To become trusted you need to build a post history and demonstrate to staff you
						| follow the SFW only nature of this site. Make sure you are logged in while posting,
						| if you use a VPN you may also want to include 'nohide' option in email to attach 
						| your account name to posts so that staff may view your post history. When you become 
						| trusted you are free to stop using 'nohide'. Default posting behavior hides account 
						| names from staff, 'nohide' is an opt-in feature to help us.
