						| We are here to have fun and spend our limited time on this planet
						| doing something meaningful. For everyone it's different, but nearly all 
						| posters here agree that they enjoy anthro media. We are not here to
						| crusade or start a revolution, but we believe in making a difference and 
						| building a community focused around art and enjoying ourselves. 
						| If you love anthros and need a chill place to talk about them,
						| you are in the right place.

		table
			tr
				th: a(href='#why-free-speech')  Why free speech?
			tr
				td
					p
						| We believe in FREEDOM, within reason, because any freedoms you give up are never returned.
						| On this site, illegal, hostile, and grossly obscene content should be the main prohibitions. 
						| To forbid more than what is necessary is to erode the freedoms that the staff want you to have. 
						| Staff should not be the main gatekeepers. Rather, the community should be the ones gatekeeping.
					p
						| It is the communities job to PROMOTE and POST the content they like, and IGNORE or DISCOURAGE the content that they dislike.
						| If it is not highly obscene, it should not need to be removed.
						| However, any disagreements MUST BE CIVIL, that is, with respect for one another.
						| Uncivil behavior, via unreasonable anger, hostility or spam, should not be taken seriously.
						| If such incivility is extreme, it should then warrant either post removal or even a possible ban.
						| It should not be the staff's job to tailor a safe space hugbox. 
						| Rather, the posters here should already have the thick skin required to use imageboards beforehand.
						| Freedom is important, You do not know what you have until it is gone.
					p
						| Ideally, the only posters that are banned are those who have no interest 
						| in the site's topic, that is, posting or discussing anthros.

				th: a(href='#why-i-see-things-i-dont-like')  Why do I see things I don't like?
			tr
				td
					p
						| Any site that leans towards free-speech will always attract posters 
						| that get censored everywhere else. However, for your sake and everyone 
						| else's, the staff minimizes subjective rules as those always depend 
						| on judgement of whoever is active at the time. For example, the arguments 
						| surrounding rule 2 are why we should minimize subjective rules.
					p
						| The ideal approach in any community is self-moderation such as filters,
						| the "selfmod" option, and mental filters. The mental approach is better 
						| because it applies everywhere else online. Stop interacting with 
						| things that make you mad, and instead spend you limited time on Earth 
						| doing things that make you happy, such as art perhaps.
					p 
						| If you are worried about "faggots", they have the rest of the internet and have 
						| no reason to stay here. They could waste time bending rule 2, or 
						| freely post on Twitter, and 99 times out of 100 they will choose to stay
						| on Twitter. There is a reason Furanons call them bait threads, and that's
						| because it's true. Someone sees you get upset, so they will post anything 
						| to get a reaction out of you. Stricter moderation will not kill bait and 
						| will only make you more sensitive to it, so learn to ignore it.
					p
						| Remember this: bait posts seek attention and denying them attention will
						| make them resort to spam, which then should warrant a ban.

			tr
				th: a(href='#why-sfw') Why SFW only?
			tr
				td
					p
						| It makes us unique, provides people a space who want a SFW only site,
						| and keeps the site healthy. We are the only, as far as I'm aware,
						| open for all SFW site and there is a demand for a SFW imageboard.
						| It also makes it easier to moderate the site and avoids the blurry line
						| of what is and isn't allowed. Remember that unlike 4chan, the staff here are
						| all volunteers who also want to enjoy the site. Looking at porn all day,
						| is not what any of us want to do.

			tr
				th: a(href='#name-formatting') Name formatting
			tr
				td.post-message
					p When posting, you can format the name field to include a name, tripcode , capcode, any combination of the three including leaving the field completely blank.
					b Format
					p 
						| Names should be input like: 
						input(disabled='true' spellcheck='false' type='text' value='Name##Tripcode## Capcode')
						| . Tripcode and capcode are optional components. Please note the whitespace before capcodes is significant. 
					p Valid examples: 
					ol.mv-0
						li name
						li #tripcode
						li ##tripcode
						li ## capcode
						li name#tripcode
						li name##tripcode
						li name## capcode
						li name#tripcode## capcode
						li name##tripcode## capcode
						li #tripcode## capcode
						li ##tripcode## capcode
						li ##
					p The last example is considered a blank capcode and can be used as a shortcut to display your role. Additionally, if a user has multiple aplicable roles (e.g. a board owner, but the user is also global staff) capcodes will default to their lowest role. To show the higher role, you must be explicit and precede any capcode with the role name e.g. ## Global Staff or ## Global Staff capcode
					p Each component can be used in combination or independently. In a post number 9 would look like:
						-
							const examplePost = {
								"date" : new Date("2019-08-02T09:48:44.180Z"),
								"name" : "name",
								"board" : "example",
								"tripcode" : "!!X8NXmAS44=",
								"capcode" : "##Board Owner capcode",
								"message" : "Hello, world!",
								"nomarkup" : "Hello, world!",
								"thread" : 1,
								"password" : null,
								"email" : "",
								"spoiler" : false,
								"banmessage" : null,
								"files" : [ ],
								"reports" : [ ],
								"globalreports" : [ ],
								"quotes" : [ ],
								"backlinks" : [ ],
								"postId" : 123
							}	
						+post(examplePost)
					p The name appears bold in the top left, followed by the tripcode in regular weight with a !! prefix, then the capcode in a different color, bold and with a ## prefix. The colours may vary between themes but are generally distinct from each other

					b Name
					p The name is simply what name you want to be shown alongside your post. Other users can post with the same name so there is nothing preventing impersonation. This is not related to your username (for registered users).

					b Tripcode
					p A tripcode is a password of sorts, which users can provide in the tripcode component of their name. This tripcode is used in conjunction with a server-known secret to generate a unique* tripcode portion of the name. Long, unique tripcodes can be used as a form of identity. It is important that you keep tripcodes secret if you use them for some form of identity. A compromised tripcode can be used for impersonation and cannot be revoked in any way. Single # before tripcodes will use the traditional (what is now sometimes known as "insecure") tripcode algorithm shared by many imageboard softwares and websites. Double # before tripcodes will use a sha256 hash with server-side secret for a more secure, non-portable tripcode.

					b Capcode
					p A capcode is a component of the name field only available to authenticated users. This includes admins, global staff, board owners and board staff. If there is no text after the ##, the role will be displayed alone. Leaving a space and putting custom text will be prefixed by the role name. This way, the role is always shown to prevent role impersonation.

				th: a(href='#file-approval') File approval
			tr
				td
					b File approval
					p 
						| To protect users and honor the SFW only nature of this site. I implemented file approval.
						| New users will have their files pending approval, and need a moderator to verify that 
						| rules are not broken. Before a file is approved a 'File Pending Approval' replacement is 
						| shown, but after approval users will see the original file.
					b Trust system 
					p
						| Users may wish to create an account and become 'Trusted' to bypass file approval. 
						| To become trusted you need to build a post history and demonstrate to staff you
						| follow the SFW only nature of this site. Make sure you are logged in while posting,
						| if you use a VPN you may also want to include 'nohide' option in email to attach 
						| your account name to posts so that staff may view your post history. When you become 
						| trusted you are free to stop using 'nohide'. Default posting behavior hides account 
						| names from staff, 'nohide' is an opt-in feature to help us.
